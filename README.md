A new Weather project.

Sure! Here's the translated and slightly polished version in English:


**Hello everyone! 🌦️**  
I'm excited to share my **third weather application** developed with Flutter! This new version brings significant improvements in both design and functionality. 🚀  

**Key Features:**  
🔹 **Daily Weather Details:** A clear interface displaying essential information like wind speed, humidity, precipitation probability, and temperature forecasts.  
🔹 **Weekly Forecast:** View the weather predictions for the entire week in a clean and user-friendly list format.  
🔹 **Dynamic and Interactive Interface:** Tap on any day in the weekly forecast to access detailed weather information for that specific day.  
🔹 **Modern and Sleek Design:** Built using Flutter's flexible widget structure to deliver an aesthetic and intuitive user experience.  

This project has been a great step forward in enhancing my Flutter development skills and pushing the boundaries of my creativity. My next goal is to add **data visualization tools** and **more advanced interactive features**. 🌍  

**I’d love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!** Your feedback inspires me to improve and innovate. 😊
